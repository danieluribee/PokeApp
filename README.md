## Objective
A company wants to build a Pokemon SPA demo using Angular as base framework to give the ability to find and list any pokemon.
The company is concerned about the user experience so you need to consider the followings constraints in your solution:

    - Include a Form (input text and submit button) where the user could find an specific Pokemon by name.
    - List and present all the pokemon characters below the form [use](http://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/)
        with his own name and image [to get the image you should use](http://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{name}/)
        for each pokemon previously listed.
    - If the user enters a pokemon name the app should filter the list by name.
    - If the input value is empty then the app should to present all the pokemon list.

If you want to consider to handle loading elements or pagination to increase the performance, it would give you some extra points.
